# IGTV-Performance

**Question**

Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

**Approach**
To measure the success of Instagram TV (IGTV), I focussed on user interaction data such as :

Views - The number of times an IGTV video has been viewed.
Likes - The number of likes received on IGTV videos.
Comments - The number of comments posted on IGTV videos.
Unique Viewers - The total unique viewers on a certain video.
